# Bagger Invitational for iOS

This directory contains the Step 2A native SwiftUI bootstrap for **Bagger Preview**. It proves the isolated Preview environment, email OTP, Supabase session, Bagger identity certification, canonical participant resolution, secure restoration, and sign-out. It is not the full tournament application.

## Requirements

- macOS with Xcode 26.6
- iOS 26.5 Simulator runtime
- An iPhone 17 Pro Max simulator for the primary validation destination
- iOS 16.0 or newer for the app deployment target
- Access to the client-safe Preview Supabase configuration

The project uses Swift 6 and the official Supabase Swift package through Swift Package Manager. Xcode resolves package dependencies when the project is opened or built.

## Open the project

Open `ios/BaggerInv.xcodeproj` in Xcode, select the shared `BaggerInv` scheme, and choose an iPhone simulator. The development app uses the reversible bundle identifier:

`com.sandbaggerinvitational.bagger.preview`

The app is intentionally presented as **Bagger Preview**, and the bootstrap UI keeps a visible `PREVIEW` indicator.

## Configure isolated Preview

Create the local configuration from the checked-in example:

```sh
cp ios/Config/Preview.xcconfig.example ios/Config/Preview.xcconfig
```

Keep these values in `Preview.xcconfig`:

- `BAGGER_API_BASE_URL`: `https://native-preview.baggerinv.com`
- `SUPABASE_URL`: the isolated Preview Supabase project URL from the approved configuration
- `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: the Preview client-safe publishable/anon key

`Preview.xcconfig` is intentionally ignored by Git, while `Preview.xcconfig.example` is reproducible and safe to commit. Supabase project URLs and publishable/anon keys are client-safe public configuration; they do not grant server authority.

Never place any of the following in the iOS project or local client configuration:

- Supabase service-role or server secret keys
- Bagger certification signing secrets
- rate-limit hashing secrets
- Turnstile secrets
- Vercel tokens or protection-bypass credentials
- Google credentials
- Apple private keys
- OTPs, access tokens, refresh tokens, or Bagger certification proofs

Do not add a Production API, Production Supabase project, runtime discovery mechanism, or fallback. Authentication remains disabled until the app receives the exact certified isolated-development `/api/mobile/v1/health` authority response.

## Run in Simulator

In Xcode:

1. Select the `BaggerInv` scheme.
2. Select **iPhone 17 Pro Max (iOS 26.5)**.
3. Press Run.

The same build can be exercised from the command line:

```sh
xcodebuild \
  -project ios/BaggerInv.xcodeproj \
  -scheme BaggerInv \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro Max,OS=26.5' \
  build
```

The app must remain on isolated Preview throughout the flow. A configuration error or authority mismatch fails closed and prevents login.

## Run tests

Run the focused native unit tests in Xcode with Product > Test, or use:

```sh
xcodebuild \
  -project ios/BaggerInv.xcodeproj \
  -scheme BaggerInv \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro Max,OS=26.5' \
  test
```

Tests use injected transports and stores where appropriate. They do not require or authorize Production access.

## Run on a physical iPhone

Physical-device testing uses normal automatic development signing only:

1. Connect and unlock the iPhone, then trust the Mac if prompted.
2. In Xcode Settings > Accounts, sign in with the development Apple ID.
3. Select the `BaggerInv` target, open Signing & Capabilities, enable automatic signing, and choose the development team.
4. Enable Developer Mode on the iPhone if Xcode requests it.
5. Select the connected iPhone as the run destination and press Run.

A paid Apple Developer Program membership is not required for Simulator use. Do not create distribution signing, TestFlight builds, App Store Connect records, push-notification entitlements, or Production provisioning during Step 2A.

## Architecture and security boundaries

- `App/` owns the single state machine and coordinates launch, authentication, restoration, and sign-out.
- `Configuration/` loads and validates the fixed Preview environment and exact authority attestation.
- `Auth/` owns official Supabase Swift OTP verification and session lifecycle.
- `Captcha/` contains the tightly allowlisted WKWebView used only for Turnstile.
- `Networking/` owns typed async HTTP transport and centralized protected headers.
- `Security/` stores the Bagger certification and sensitive session state in Keychain-backed storage.
- `Models/` contains only the Step 2A mobile v1 contracts.
- `Views/` contains temporary bootstrap and diagnostic SwiftUI, not final product screens.

The app does not read canonical Bagger tables through Supabase. Supabase establishes the native Auth session; the mobile v1 API separately certifies that identity and returns the canonical Bagger Player. Protected API calls require both the Supabase Bearer token and the signed Bagger certification.

## Current scope

Step 2A includes:

- exact Preview health/authority verification
- native Turnstile challenge
- server-mediated email OTP request
- Supabase Swift OTP verification and secure session restoration
- Bagger certification stored securely in Keychain
- canonical participant `/session` validation
- temporary signed-in diagnostic UI
- secure sign-out

Step 2A intentionally does not include Today, Matches, Score, Leaders, More, phone OTP UI, direct Supabase table access, scoring reads or writes, an offline mutation queue, push notifications, TestFlight, or Production native configuration.

## Next step

Step 2B will add the shared native mobile read/cache foundation for `/today`, `/matches`, `/leaders`, and `/schedule`. It should extend the existing authenticated transport with ETag revalidation, participant-scoped cache partitioning, cancellation, request deduplication, and deterministic fixtures. It must preserve the Preview authority bootstrap and dual Bearer-plus-Bagger-certification security boundary. Step 2B must not add direct Supabase canonical-table access or mix read caching with the later durable scoring queue.
